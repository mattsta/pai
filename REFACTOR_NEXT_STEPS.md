# Polyglot AI: Refactoring Status

All major refactoring phases outlined in this document have been successfully completed.

The core goals of this effort were:
- Centralizing UI state management.
- Decoupling business logic from the UI via an Orchestrator layer.
- Formalizing the contracts between Commands and the UI/Client.
- Improving the robustness and clarity of the Tool system.

This work is now complete. The history of these changes has been preserved in the `ARCHITECTURE.md` document for future reference.
